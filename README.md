# E-commerce Data Analysis Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project is a data analysis dashboard created using Microsoft Power BI. It is designed to provide insights into e-commerce data, allowing businesses to make informed decisions based on visual representations of their data.

## Key Graphs

1. **Stacked Bar Chart**: The stacked bar chart visualizes data in a way that shows the composition of a category or metric over time or across categories. It is used to understand the distribution of data elements within different dimensions.

2. **Stacked Column Chart**: Similar to the stacked bar chart, the stacked column chart displays data in a vertical format. It's commonly used to compare data across categories and show how individual components contribute to the total.

3. **Donut Chart**: The donut chart is a visually appealing way to display the proportion of various categories within a whole. It's ideal for showing the relationship between different data elements and their contribution to the whole.
